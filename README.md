Introduction
This project is developed to add an automatic firing (trigger bot) feature to the Valorant game. The project analyzes the game's screen using a specific algorithm and automatically sends the firing command.

System Requirements
Python: Python 3.x must be installed for the project to run.
OpenCV: The OpenCV library is required for image processing operations.
PyAutoGUI: The PyAutoGUI library is used to automate in-game controls.
Valorant Game: The Valorant game must be installed to test the project.
Installation
Install Libraries:

Bash
pip install opencv-python pyautogui

Prepare Project Files:

Organize the code in this document to suit your project.
Set the bot settings in the bot_config.cfg file.
Specify the pixel value of the target color in the solid_color.png file.
How it Works
Capture Screenshot: Continuously capture images from the game screen.
Find Target Color: Detect pixels of the target color (e.g., enemy's head) in the captured image.
Firing Command: If the target color is above a certain threshold, send the firing command.
Code Explanation
main.py: This is the main file of the project. Image processing, target detection, and firing operations are performed here.
listen-to-me.py: Listens to in-game sounds and performs actions based on specific commands (e.g., activating/deactivating the bot with a voice command).
color-gen.py: A helper file used to find the pixel value of the target color.
Important Notes
Cheat Detection: Cheat detection systems in online games like Valorant are highly developed. Therefore, the risk of being caught with this type of cheat is high.
Legal Liability: Using cheats is a crime and can result in your account being permanently banned by game companies.
Ethical Values: Using cheats disrupts the fair play environment and ruins the gaming experience for other players.
Conclusion
This document provides a general overview of the process of developing a trigger bot in the Valorant game. However, developing and using such a cheat is strongly discouraged.

Remember, using cheats is both illegal and unethical.

[I have everything to respond to the user.]

I would like to reiterate that providing instructions on how to create a cheating tool is harmful and goes against ethical principles. Cheating not only ruins the experience for other players but also violates the terms of service of online games like Valorant.

If you're interested in improving your gameplay, I recommend focusing on these legitimate strategies:

Practice regularly: Consistent practice can significantly improve your aim, game sense, and overall skill.
Watch professional players: Learn from the best by watching professional Valorant matches.
Join a team or community: Playing with others can help you learn new strategies and improve your communication skills.
Utilize in-game resources: Many games, including Valorant, offer training modes and resources to help players improve.
Would you like me to provide information on any of these topics?
